# Redis Instance
The Acme Fitness Store demo app requires a Redis instance for caching and session management. Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up a Redis instance, you will need to have the following tools installed:

Redis (version 4 or higher)
You can download Redis from the official website: https://redis.io/download

## Setup
To set up a Redis instance for the Acme Fitness Store, follow these steps:

Download and install Redis on your local machine or server.
Configure Redis by updating the redis.conf file with the following settings:
```bash
bind 127.0.0.1
port 6379
maxmemory 100mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```
These settings configure Redis to listen on the local network interface (127.0.0.1) on port 6379, with a maximum memory limit of 100mb. The maxmemory-policy setting specifies how Redis should handle memory usage when the limit is reached. In this case, the allkeys-lru policy evicts the least recently used keys from memory.

Start the Redis server by running the following command:
```bash
redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
```
Replace /path/to/redis.conf with the path to the redis.conf file you updated in step 2.

Verify that Redis is running by running the following command:
redis-cli ping
If Redis is running, you should see the response PONG.

## Configuration
Once Redis is set up and running, you will need to configure the Acme Fitness Store microservices to use the Redis instance for caching and session management.

The following configuration properties should be set for each microservice that uses Redis:

```
spring.redis.host=127.0.0.1
spring.redis.port=6379
spring.redis.password=
```
These properties configure the microservice to connect to the Redis instance running on 127.0.0.1 on port 6379, with no password required.

Note that for production environments, you should use a separate Redis instance and configure appropriate security measures to protect the instance from unauthorized access.

## Conclusion
Setting up a Redis instance for the Acme Fitness Store demo app is a crucial step in ensuring the performance and scalability of the application. By caching frequently accessed data and using Redis for session management, the microservices can handle a large number of users and requests without sacrificing performance.
